David shall be great in this UK

DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organization's ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity: evolving and improving products at a faster pace than organizations using traditional software development and infrastructure management processes. I won't be discouraged on what I am going through at the moment because Christ is my bedrock and sufficiency.


MY TODAY'S QUOTES FOR APRIL 1, 2024


The Lord is my Shepherd, I shall not want.
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures.
He leadeth me inthe path of righteousness
For His name sake.
Yea, though I walk through the valley of shadow of death,
I will fear no evil, for thou art with me.
Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.
He preparest a table before me in the presence of my enemies,
He anointed my head with, my cup runneth over.
Surely, goodness and mercy shall follow me all the the days of my life.
And I shall dwell in the house of the LORD forever and ever. Amen
